## AI from scratch

That's what I'm currently focusing on.

Always wanted to learn the thing. Always was postponing it. No more. Doing daily videos to apply social pressure on myself.

## Fotmob.com

That was a time when I was striving to become a great web developer.

Working remotely & enjoying my life as an Digital Nomad. Expert Full-Stack JS Developer.

Maintaining old code was becoming more and more cumbersome. New features were taking too much time to adapt to old base.  

Rewrote the website from scratch.  One module after another. The whole site is ported to a new code base. Took me around 6-8 months.

## Web development from scratch

Here I was sitting in my bedroom. In my mother's home. Thinking how can I become independent.  

Stumbled upon a podcast where guy was talking about working on a beach in Thailand. Working remotely as a freelancer.   

Got excited. 

Don't have degree. Started learning from books & videos. Doing my pet projects.  
Got an entry level job from some forum. Got another one after that. Kept improving. Now consider my skills to be great.

Took me quite some time. 3-5 years depending on the metric.

The issue is so complex my head hurts every time I think about it. 

With this I'm starting the new series on Work Ethic issue. By the end of this I want to have a fine algorithm on how to tackle any work-related problem whatsoever.

- And by problem I mean situation, because there are no **real** problems in my life. Big thanks to our current civilization and the previous generations of people who have ensured that we live a good enough life not thinking about food and where to sleep that night. We have electricity - what else do we need to be fair? 

- With writing it's always easy to start talking about things that are not related to your current topic. But that what makes writing so unique, isn't it? That what separates good writers (not me) and mediocre ones (hello).

- Hey bro, what if you stop procrastinating on the work ethic issue and stop talking about our civilization and such and tell me what you have to tell me about this work ethic stuff?

- Alright sport, I am quite sure that by the end of this we'll have an eloquent structure for tackling such issues. I'd need your help in this one. What issues do you currently have that might be targeted by those words *work ethic*?

- Let's say, I'd like to do more at my current job. And I'm a programmer. I'd like to achieve success in my field. What about yourself?

- I'd like to know what to do when I wake up. I'd like to know when should I wake up and what contributes to the success in any given moment. More likely in a span of moments. That is, in a day/week/month/season/year. 

- Aren't you being stupid? You wake up at the time you've woken up - you go to work. ??? Profit. 

- That is one of the ways to do it, as I reckon. But don't you know that efficiency differs depending on how well you structure your day, your habits and so on?

- Alright, but how deep do you wanna go on this one? If we start talking on a day structure, routines and such - it will take tons of time.

- But then I believe that we'd have to start with this. If it's the thing that popped up in the conversation. And then we'd **just** untangle the rest of the work ethic fractal, shall we?

- I mean... you're the one doing all the work. And I'm the one who's calling you stupid. So let's go.

- Sure, Day Structure part of the Work Ethic fractal then. That's the category we've been looking for. For now.

- Me myself, I wake up at 8am, do some stuff at home, take shower, coffee, eat, then hit the road and arrive at the office at 10am. Working 8 hours every day (I'd like to have your opinion on working such lengthy hours bruh), one hour lunch - I'm exiting office at around 7pm. At home at 8pm. Thus, 12 hours to cover my bills, put me somewhere in social environemt so that I won't become like you, talking to imaginary friend to uncover work ethic issue. Find yourself a job bro.

- Psst, don't expose yourself and myself alright. The stuff is complex enough without this wordly truth.

- Yeah after all we'd all benifit from your findings, if you're rigorous enough in your self study. And general patterns of the world study. You know what I mean.

- So much water... we're off the track. Last milestone was... Day Structure part of the Work Ethic fractal. Let's get back to it. I'll prepare a picture on how I see it, we'll talk about it more. Would that be something you're interested in?

- I love pictures bro. One picture worth a thousand words. So cut us some slack and bring it on!

- Right, give me some time for this. I'll get back in the second part of the series. See you around. 

- それじゃ.

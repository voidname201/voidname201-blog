## Why do I make Youtube videos (self inception)

I hold an inherent understanding or belief. If I do it every day for some time. If humans will do some activity daily. Habitually. New activity like the videos was for me. It will introduce us to new places in life.

**Main point**. It is an experiment. Before & after. What will happen.

**Fighting with insecurity**. As a bonus point. If I'm putting my cringy videos out there. That any fellow human being can potentially watch. That is one hell of a stress for this *insecurity neural establishment* that was formed in my brain in my upbringing. Therefore, if nothing bad happens - insecurity will lose it's roots. And the excuse to top it: eventually the quality will be transformed to production-quality videos that many people really enjoy to watch. To be fair the dopamine level of youtube now is on the lows. So many great videos are out. The threshold is higher than the clouds. When every product is great - none are great.

**Inspiring others**. As a bonus point. I can always say: look, my videos are bad. Not on par to other creators. I'm putting them out every day though. I'm not even working on them much at all. But improving them nonetheless. Remember Pareto. Therefore, the listener might have a perspective on his own thinking process. The effect will be more massive if my videos will be watched by thousands of people after some time.

I already see changes. Weird. It has been only a week or so. I can retrospect my mind thanks to vids, recursion argument. Our homeostasis is conflicting with our future self image. Introducing extremely small incremental changes to this 4th dimentional reality instead of it being in your head only is the way to coincide them. 

Even then, I think putting videos as a daily journal might be too big of a thing for some people. Younger me. Twitter might be easier. Instagram. One picture a day. One post a day. Half post a day. 25% post a day. Divide until you feel comfortable. Don't laugh at it being miniscule challenge. Laugh when you do it for a year. It's impossible in nature. Find a golden cut for your situation.

## Multiple modes of producing videos

Every one of them has repercussions. But all of them can be great with a proper mind-set. That's the belief I'm going into that venture with.

1. section title. cut. talk; [title.cut.talk; title.cut.talk...]
1. one take solution [current]
1. multiple takes & cuts
1. multiple videos instead of one

For the situation: One has commited in his head to put out multiple videos.
I can blend the modes and use them interchangeably as much as I want to.

What is the value of that list? It can be bloated and not. It can be extended infinitely and not. I'll write as long as it goes. Which structures emerge. Those will stay. Not forcing ideas out of my brain.

Pros & cons of each one? Doesn't matter. Use what is fit at the moment. Practicality.

## What if I put out a video a day for a year?

Me talking about day-to-day categories that bother me. Will they stop bothering me? Will I be devastated talking about the same things over and over and will have to work on them - in order to not talk about them in the video, because potentially the whole world is watching?

## Mutation

How does one go about improving his channel? I mean don't you all have the fear that the content will become stale? What if you reject one idea as not suitable at the moment (e.g. me walking around in the video) but then it's perfectly great and could be encrusted later on, due to improvement of understanding and the overall process.

Mother Earth's answer to that is mutation. Or so is the common engineering way of viewing this problem from the biological perspective.

Being a retired programmer I always have only one way of seeing the problem... To create an App for it ðŸ˜‚

Behold. **Mutation Modules**. Solving a creative professions problem of being creative. By using the same genes available in the pool at different times. Elegant. Beautiful. 10/10 hacker news. [?]

## Multiple modes of relating information as a human being

I can talk. I can write. I can think & act without words. 

Again, each one seems to have repercussions. Talking makes me think less what I'm talking about. After some time I will go into direction I was not intending to go at first. If I'm not thinking about what to say. Or not making a conscious interruption of the flow. 

It can be a bad thing. If you're arguing with someone.

It can be a good thing. If it is a daily journal like the one I'm putting on the Youtube. Makes me force my being to talk about things that really are important.

## Synergy. Before & after go along with each other

Vlog & blog seem to really synergise with eath other. Like characters in a computer game. Handing me the way to solve a problem with me under-talking on my vlog. I'd just follow up on the blog. That's what's up now.

So many thoughts have popped up in that video. And I didn't want to create it. It's like a new location in a dark-field informational space was discovered. By employing the "just do it" structure of being. Now I have two pieces of content. One is better than the other. Both of them have now ideas to follow up about.

For it to be even more helpful to one each other. Let me introduce categories to talk about in the video. Stable ones. 

I can talk about not having things to talk about. Then the thing will pop up eventually. How ironic is that. Therefore, heaven is great. Earth is great.People are great.

I can have a project and put out a daily progress I'm making on that project. The nowadays projects are: me having an experiment of putting a video every day to see what'll come of it; me writing in a blog, more chaotically, put some consistency is there; fast.ai challenge, always wanted to learn ai, keeping myself out of it daily [how conflicting are those notions, people are funny ðŸ¤¦]

## Social pressure

I'm keeping myself accountable by making that daily vjournal. Promising to improve by 1% every day. It seems to work for now. It has been small amount of time to judge thoroughly.

Cool idea to wrap my head around. Keeping my future self accountable for the shit I want. That's the social pressure in a nutshell. The guy before (my younger self) didn't make a good job of getting things done. So I'm putting my stakes on my older self. And ensuring he has a good time by pressuring him ^_^.

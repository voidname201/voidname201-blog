## Motivation
> What is the meaning of an act? <br>
> One's idea doesn't matter - one's execution of it does. <br>
> These words travel through time. <br>
> Human & Laptop. All the power needed. <br>
> To use it, one must learn. <br>
> Therefore, I am Here & Now. <br>

## Metrics of completion
**Phase 1.**
6 months. Kaggle top 20%. One competition. <br>
& a project of my own. Polished.

**Phase 2.**
More months. Kaggle top 10%. 3-5 competitions. <br> 
& 3-5 projects of my own. Good ones.

## The bright future 
What will be different after I finish the journey? Let's see if my prognosis will be adequate in a span of several months.

**Opportunities**. Cool ideas that I'd be able to implement. Understanding problem solving on a much broader scale than I do now. Job offers from different places I've never heard about.

**Satisfaction**. I had an idea. I mapped an idea through time. I persevered. Done. Thus, we'd be able to tackle another interesting project. Learning is not that fun after all. Where the fun is? Learning & Doing. 

Therefore, let's stop procrastinating and head back to learning & hacking.

Alright, how does one go about doing things? We usually follow some role model, be it our parents, our neighbors, our friends/accomplices. We look for what they do. We think can we do it. We do it. Repeat.

I have some questions though: 
- Can we be truly original about doing things? It goes further:
- Are we able to consciously choose not only *What* to do, but *How*/*When* to do it as well?
- Can we examine the tasks from the *Efficiency/Effectiveness* perspectives? And if we can, what would be the time/effort cost for that level of elaboration on such simple ideas.

I can get really paranoid about this. Although thinking on how to breathe and walk can be too cumbersome - when we take yogis into account everything comes to make sense again, because those humans practice breathing a-a-all day long. That's quite a challenge. At least for me and for people I personally know.

What I'd like to do is to focus on day-to-day tasks, things, duties one might have in the current civilization that has us. I'll just start with myself, use retrospection, share with you guys, and have us run the constant feedback loop - if that sounds interesting to any given reader, such as *You*, my friend.

## What do we humans normally ought to do?

**I mean... We eat**, alright. All the diets, vitamins, minerals, body mass, feeling healthy, the notion of "you're what you eat" - One's head might explode if he'd be brave enough to dive in the subject unprepared:
> How many times per day do you eat?
> How are you going to prepare the food? What about the menu? Have you thought about the variety of dishes?

A lot to tackle, we'll get them one by one, one day... trust me if you're brave enough.

**We tend to sleep as well**; very good idea to do it sometimes. By the way, let's talk about sleeping for a bit. It's not only about sleeping right. Sleeping is a *veeeery* easy endeavor to undergo...

But do you know where the real issue lies in? In waking up! Just how do you wake up consistently and stop using your divine ability to sleep "just 10 minutes more"?!

Interesting topic to meddle with since it deals with time... And the Time is of the essence, as we all know all too well. You've woken up just one hour later - the day is lost, the emotional condition is questionable, be careful not to lose your job and loved ones. All just because you've overslept - What a Universe we live in!

**Occupation and the rest.** With the job you do, it will consume most of your day, alongside sleep and eating (and commute).

- -- - - - -- - -
Thus, we have the *Big Three* and the rest. Everything else really is secondary (if you think about it rigidly enough), but so desirable to us. We'll take an in-depth look at how to structure our lives regarding this category of being, the desire.

## The *Real* Retrospective

Get this... this is my first post, alright. Where do I wanna steer the Captain's wheel of this blog? What is the final destination? What is the thematic?

That's an easy one coz boy do I have some things to talk about, to research and share the findings, to bust through special challenges, and so on. (After all, I've been putting off this thingy for about 5 years!) Namely:

- **Learning AI**
  
  The big one since I've always wanted to go here, but the path was closed due to my lack of mathematical acquaintance. Or the inadequate assessment of one's strength... and that time I've lost, lost a lot.
  
  But let Us hope we'll get back on track soon, since mathematics is highly learnable, especially since we have khanacademy.org and youtube.com at our disposal - and not always needed. At least for the utilizing building AI programs skills it might be so.
  
- Book reviews
  - Duh. From Motivation & Personality to Tao Te Ching.
- Philosophical research
  - Self-actualization, transcendence, AI, success, family, social media and beyond.
- DAO research
  - Those who know - Do not talk. Those who talk - Do not know.
- Interpersonal relationships
  - Ah precious people... why is it so immensely complicated. If one simply wants to deal with sisters-and-brothers-humans and leave no harm done to each other.
- Inside-one's-self relationships (change the name later...)
  - Mostly I'd say it's about the mind, how does it talk to us, what does it usually say. We're all schizophrenic by design - what should we do about it!
- One Punch Man's training regimen
  - Ooph, the hell of a challenge. If you know what I'm talking about.
- Music
  - I currently have some kind of understanding how to play guitar... But there's so much more to it. Incredibly interesting category.

A lot of things to cover. I'm thinking to start tackling them one by one. And that would be the thematic of a blog. How one guy uses the blog and social pressure to do things he always wanted to do.

Then, we'd naturally see the tendency of the writing and more themes and ideas will emerge.

## Final prose

As the light is getting reflected from your retina, the information is getting processed by your visual cortex... I name you the **Champion!** Dear reader. 

You know English and are possessed by an ability to read. Which, if we take some things in mind, is one of the main skills that separates us from animal kingdom. Thus, you might be called human. ðŸŽ‰

But enough from me, I shall learn when to stop. Stay tuned for more illiterate extravaganza!

There goes my first blog post ever. Which as I hinted earlier I was putting off for... around 5-7 years. By being succumbed to fear, sloth, and other worldly oppulence. No more. High hopes. Much support neededðŸ¤ž

## Bonus: Unstructured thoughts (that haven't made it into the article, but shall be recorded in order to appear in the next ones.)

> As I've seen the Ali Abdaal's video on getting started putting yourself out there, nothing can be better than just starting putting yourself out there! You'll be able to find my transcription of the video with my comments on it [**ri-i-ight here**](/posts/ali-video-key-takeaways).

> How do I compare writing blog posts with working full-time? It's a bit early to compare the two, since I've just left the first and started the second. But bare with me, we'll shot an article about that in a span of weeks.

> Imagine how powerful my blog can get if I spend the same amount of effort consistently as I'd be working full-time for another person in charge. But here I put **You** in charge, my dear reader. Press Ctrl + W if you're bored... Press Ctrl + D if you're engaged.
